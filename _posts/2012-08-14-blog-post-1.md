The Bus Routes problem on LeetCode challenges us to find the minimum number of buses required to travel from a source stop to a destination stop. In this article, we’ll explore an optimized approach to solving this problem.

Introduction
======

The Bus Routes problem on LeetCode challenges us to find the minimum number of buses required to travel from a source stop to a destination stop. In this article, we’ll explore an optimized approach to solving this problem.

# Problem Overview

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `ith` bus repeats forever.

- For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return *the least number of buses you must take to travel from* `source` *to* `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
Output: -1
```

# Problem Explaination

Consider a scenario where buses follow a set of routes, each consisting of multiple stops. The goal is to determine the minimum number of buses needed to reach a destination stop from a given source stop. It’s a classic graph traversal problem that can be efficiently solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach.

# Initial Approach

In my initial approach, Irepresented the bus routes and stops using a graph. I employed a breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph, exploring possible routes from the source stop to the destination stop. The use of defaultdict and deque from the collections module facilitated the implementation.

# Initial Implementation

Let’s take a look at the initial implementation:

```
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], S: int, T: int) -> int:
        # Create a defaultdict to represent the graph of stops and routes
        graph = defaultdict(set)

        # Populate the graph with stops and the routes that pass through them
        for i, route in enumerate(routes):
            for stop in route:
                graph[stop].add(i)
        
        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum number of steps
        ans = 0

        # Initialize a queue for BFS with the source stop
        queue = deque([S])

        # Create a set to keep track of visited stops
        seen_stop = set()

        # Create a set to keep track of visited routes
        seen_route = set()

        # Mark the source stop as visited
        seen_stop.add(S)

        # Perform BFS until the queue is empty
        while queue:
            # Process all stops in the current level of the BFS
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                # Dequeue the current stop
                stop = queue.popleft()

            # Check if the current stop is the destination stop
            if stop == T:
                return ans
            
            # Iterate over the routes that include the current stop
            for routeID in graph[stop]:
                # Iterate over the stops in the current route
                for new_stop in routes[routeID]:
                    # Check if the next stop has not been visited
                    if new_stop not in seen_stop:
                        # Enqueue the next stop and mark it as visited
                        queue.append(new_stop)
                        seen_stop.add(new_stop)

            # Increment the number of steps for the next level of BFS
            ans += 1
        
        # If the destination stop cannot be reached, return -1
        return -1
```

I utilized a graph to represent bus routes and stops. However, despite passing several test cases, the code encountered Time Limit Exceeded errors for certain inputs.

# Identifying the Bottleneck

Upon closer inspection, I identified that the primary bottleneck leading to Time Limit Exceeded errors was the usage of a set for each stop to check for visited stops. This redundancy in operations needed addressing for improved efficiency.

# Optimization Strategy

To optimize the solution, I adopted a more streamlined approach. By replaced the sets for each stop with a single `seen_stops` set, reducing redundant operations. Additionally, I introduced a `seen_routes` set to avoid revisiting the same route. The removal of an unnecessary outer loop further contributed to the optimization.

# Optimized Implementation

Let’s explore the optimized version of the code:

```
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], S: int, T: int) -> int:
        # Check if the source stop is the same as the destination stop
        if S == T:
            return 0

        # Create a defaultdict to map stops to the routes that pass through them
        stop_to_routes = defaultdict(set)

        # Populate the stop_to_routes dictionary
        # Key: Stop, Value: Set of route indices that include the stop
        for i, route in enumerate(routes):
            for stop in route:
                stop_to_routes[stop].add(i)

        # Initialize a queue for BFS with the source stop and the number of steps taken
        queue = deque([(S, 0)])

        # Create a set to keep track of visited stops
        seen_stops = set([S])

        # Create a set to keep track of visited routes
        seen_routes = set()

        # Perform BFS until the queue is empty
        while queue:
            # Dequeue the current stop and the number of steps taken
            current_stop, steps = queue.popleft()

            # Check if the current stop is the destination stop
            if current_stop == T:
                return steps

            # Iterate over the routes that include the current stop
            for route_id in stop_to_routes[current_stop]:
                # Check if the route has not been visited
                if route_id not in seen_routes:
                    # Mark the route as visited
                    seen_routes.add(route_id)

                    # Explore the next stops in the route
                    for next_stop in routes[route_id]:
                        # Check if the next stop has not been visited
                        if next_stop not in seen_stops:
                            # Mark the next stop as visited
                            seen_stops.add(next_stop)

                            # Enqueue the next stop and increment the number of steps
                            queue.append((next_stop, steps + 1))

        # If the destination stop cannot be reached, return -1
        return -1
```

# Testing and Results

In the testing phase, the optimized solution successfully passed test cases that previously resulted in Time Limit Exceeded errors. This indicates a significant improvement in the efficiency of the code.
