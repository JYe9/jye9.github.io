👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Cyprus.

🔬 My research interests are in Computer vision and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Mutiple Stereo Cameras indoor 3D Positioning System](https://github.com/JYe9/multiple_OAK-D_cameras_3D_indoor_positioning) an open-source project for indoor 3D positioning using Deep Learning Algorithim.

Moreover, I have published a [research paper](https://jye9.github.io//publication/2023-06-26-CNN-based-Real-time-Forest-Fire-Detection-System) at the 31st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED) conference.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience in independent research. I have reproduced many of the classic papers in **Computer Vision** using Python, and the reproduced code can be seen in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JYe9?tab=repositories).

<!-- Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as a **Software Engineer**. \
I utilise python and C# for software development.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@kristianye562) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@skristian266) channel for AI-related content.
